        <h3>1.0 PROTOTYPING</h3>
        <h2>The Prototype</h2>
        <p>
            Design(human)design is a tool developed by the MIT Media Lab that randomizes prompts for designers to inspire creativity. Our prompts included creating something that is paradigm shifting, targets a disorder, and uses a CAD program. Our resolved solution was designing a bracelet for people with OCD to customize and wear functionally and fashionably. We believe its important for people to embrace their differences and we also know that everyones disorder is unique, thatâ€™s why we made them customizable. As part of the project we designed a bracelet using an online CAD program and had it 3D printed at the Engineering lab, we designed a style guide for Embrace to fit that of a mid-end luxury brand, and designed a prototype of the online customizable portion. I worked on all three smaller projects and specifically used my knowledge in UX Design to design the prototype featured here in Sketch and inVision.
