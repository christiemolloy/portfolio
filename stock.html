      <h1>Addressing the Assumptions in Apple's "Stocks" Application</h1>
      <p>
        This is a problem that I personally saw and wanted to find a solution for.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Stocks on Apple isn't an inclusive application for those who have never had an encounter with the stock market.
        The stock market can be very complicated, and although this application does a fantastic job of simplifying the interface,
        I wanted to break down some of the assumptions this application makes.

            <li> Users know the meaning behind "Price at close, price after hours"</li>
            <li> Users understand why closing and after hours prices are placed at the top of the screen.</li>   
            <li> Users will not be detered by the black background. </li>
            <li> The graphs are important enough to put on the front screen. </li>

          <h3>WIREFRAMING</h3>
          <h2>Lo-Fi Wireframes</h2>
          <p>
            Based on these assumptions, I wireframed lo-fi wireframes.

          <h2>Visual Lo-Fi Wireframes</h2>
          <p>
            As part of my design method, I will typically create a second round of lo-fi wireframes before
            moving onto hi-fi wireframes. These will shade out areas on a scale of light, moderate and dark based on the importance of that area.
            This provides context for visual decisions.

            <p>
              Adding context clues were necessary to break down the assumption that companies are described by an acronym. I added the logo, and a description underneath the acronym to supplement it.

            <p>
              This feature was added to demonstrate to the user that stock growth is time based. 
              Toggling through these time periods allows the user to compare stocks based on their growth over different times.

              I decided to remove the graphs and replace them with up/down arrows as I thought the graphs were too much information for a new user to digest, and they can view a larger more interactive graph within one tap.

            <p>
              Within a stock page, the user can toggle between different time periods for that stock. Currently on "Stocks" the page lacks hierarchy with over 20 different numbers at the same type scale.
              I wanted to change this by increasing the scale of the most important numbers per period, so I scaled by the lowest and highest price for that time period.
              I believe this hierarchy brings importance to the numbers.

            <p>
              In "Stocks" there is large amounts of information on each page, which is not necessary for every user, everytime they open the application.
              I used tabs to store this information in a place that is easily accessible.
