      <h1>Addressing the Assumptions in Apple's "Stocks" Application</h1>
      <p>
        This is a problem that I personally saw and wanted to find a solution for.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Stocks on Apple isn't an inclusive application for those who have never had an encounter with the stock market.
        The stock market can be very complicated, and although this application does a fantastic job of simplifying the interface,
        I wanted to break down some of the assumptions this application makes.

          <ul>
            <li> Users know that companies are described by acronyms.</li>
            <li> Users know the meaning behind the red and green coloring.</li>
            <li> Users know to change the time period for shares. </li>
            <li> Users know the meaning of "Open, High, Low, Vol, P/E, Mkt Capâ€¦." Etc</li>
            <li> Users know the meaning behind "Price at close, price after hours"</li>
            <li> Users understand why closing and after hours prices are placed at the top of the screen.</li>   
            <li> Users will not be detered by the black background. </li>
            <li> The graphs are important enough to put on the front screen. </li>
